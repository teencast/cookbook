* `2 cups (500 mL)` all-purpose flour
* `1 tbsp (15 mL)` white sugar
* `1 tsp (5 mL)` salt
* `1 cup (250 mL)` chilled unsalted butter
* `1/2 tsp (3 mL)` vanilla extract
* `1/4 cup (60 mL)` cold water

> Sift flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, and salt together into a bowl. Cut chilled butter into small cubes, then cut into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture resembles small peas. Add vanilla. Mix in cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough comes together and forms a ball.

---

> Divide dough into 2 pieces and wrap with plastic wrap; chill until firm, at least 1 hour.

---

* `1/2 cup (125 mL)` cream cheese
* `1/4 cup (60 mL)` unsalted butter
* `1 cup (250 mL)` powdered sugar
* `1 tsp (5 mL)` vanilla extract
* `1 tbsp (15 mL)` ground cinnamon

> Cream softened cream cheese with butter using an electric mixer and mix to combine. Add vanilla, powdered sugar, and cinnamon, and mix on low speed until there are no streaks of dry powdered sugar. Cream mixture for one minute on medium-high and chill.

---

> After dough has chilled, preheat the oven to 370° F (190° C), and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

---

> Roll out dough on a lightly floured work surface to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut dough into rectangles with a knife. Drop 1 tablespoon of filling onto half of the rectangles. Cover with remaining rectangles. Press edges with a fork to seal. Poke a few holes in the top of each pastry with a toothpick.

---

> Arrange pastries on baking sheets, and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes until golden brown. Cool pastries for 15 minutes after baking.

---

> Enjoy! (Note: I suggest chilling the pastries in the fridge for an hour before eating. If you plan to eat them warm, cut down on the butter in the dough if you don't want an overly buttery texture)
