* `1 cup` butter
* `2 1/4 cups` all-purpose flour
* `2 tsp` salt
* `1 cup` water

> Mix all ingredients with a large spoon, then when it starts to form, use your hands!!
Chill dough in fridge for 30 minutes (any more and it gets weird and flakey).

---

* `2 cups` apples (about 6)
* `a dash` lemon juice
* `1/6 cup` sugar
* `1/6 cup` ground cinnamon

> While the dough is chilling, make the filling! Peel the skin off each apple and cut it up into roughly the same size and put in a bowl. Add lemon juice, sugar, and ground cinnamon (adjust the amounts to taste), and MIX the filling! Make sure the apples are basically covered in a cinnamon-y liquid.

> Grab your dough. Put some flour on it so it doesn't stick. Roll it out and make it as big as you can ! (you can cut the dough in half, too, if that's easier). Grab your pie pan and make sure there is enough dough to put in the pan. If there is, layer the bottom part of the dough in the pan.

* `3-4 dollops` butter

> Pour in apple filling, and add butter on top!

---

> With the remainder of the dough, roll it out and layer it on top. There should be some dough hanging over the sides. Cut it so it extends just past the lip of the pie pan. then tuck both edges of the dough into the pan. You can make this look fancy by pressing into the dough all around the pan if you want! Make sure to cut a few holes in the top of the pie !!!

> Set oven temp to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake for about 50 minutes or until it is bubbling. Take out and enjoy!
